# 📘 Process

1. **Setting my learning goal** – understanding how API calls work in Swift.
2. **Choosing a reference app** – Apple's Weather App as inspiration.
3. **Finding a free weather API** to fetch real-time data.
4. **Learning how to make API calls** by reading the API documentation and watching YouTube tutorials.
5. **Studying Swift design patterns**, especially **MVVM**.
6. **Deconstructing Apple's Weather App** to understand its structure and UI flow.
7. **Coding the app in Xcode** using URLSession, Codable, and SwiftUI/UIKit.
8. **Refining and improving the app** by cleaning code, adjusting UI, and testing features.

🚀 Future Implementations

Integrate a weather map view using MapKit or a custom rendering layer.

Display heat maps for parameters such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, or precipitation.

Experiment with tile overlays, gradient layers, or Metal-based rendering for smoother animated visualizations.
